# PONG GAME

## About the game
  
  the game is written by using pure C++ code and involves
  a basic Object oriented algorithm through out the code
  

  after cloning the repository or downloading then extracting the zip file,
  the next thing to do is compiling the main.cpp file then executing the executable one.
